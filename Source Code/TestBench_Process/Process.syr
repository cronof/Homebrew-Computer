WARNING:Xst:1780 - Signal <operand> is never used or assigned. This unconnected signal will be trimmed during the optimization process.
WARNING:Xst:653 - Signal <IMEM> is used but never assigned. This sourceless signal will be automatically connected to value 0000000000000000.
INFO:Xst:2117 - HDL ADVISOR - Mux Selector <current_state> of Case statement line 102 was re-encoded using one-hot encoding. The case statement will be optimized (default statement optimization), but this optimization may lead to design initialization problems. To ensure the design works safely, you can:
   	- add an 'INIT' attribute on signal <current_state> (optimization is then done without any risk)
   	- use the attribute 'signal_encoding user' to avoid onehot optimization
   	- use the attribute 'safe_implementation yes' to force XST to perform a safe (but less efficient) optimization

INFO:Xst:1767 - HDL ADVISOR - Resource sharing has identified that some arithmetic operations in this design can share the same physical resources for reduced device utilization. For improved clock frequency you may try to disable resource sharing.
